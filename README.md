# dog_classify
classify the breed of dog


# Project Overview

Welcome to the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) project in the Data Scientist Nanodegree! 
In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline
that can be used within a web or mobile app to process real-world,
user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.
If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
